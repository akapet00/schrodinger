Improvements: the calculation of RMSE for more different numbers of collocation points should be included; graphical presentation of the relationship between the RMSE and the number of collocation points should be presented. The conclusions related to Table 1 should be more explicitly related to the values of RMSE. The analysis of the computational complexity of the propsed method should be included and compared to conventional methods.
